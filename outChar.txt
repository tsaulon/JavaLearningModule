Naples, 2001. Giorno Giovanna is a small-time crook with one big dreamâ€”to become a "Gang-Star." No ordinary thief,
Giorno has a connection to the remarkable Joestar bloodline, and possesses a Stand named Gold Experience. His dream
starts to become reality when he meets Bruno Buccellati, a mobster from the gang Passione and a fellow Stand user 
himself. Realizing that they share similar ideals, and both disagree with the gang's harmful affairs, Giorno reveals 
his goal to Bruno: with Bruno's help, he will reform Passione by overthrowing the boss.
